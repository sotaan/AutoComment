# AutoComment
I can't be the only one that forgets to put header comments with my name, date and project in them.

This is a bash script you can run that checks for files that do not have a comment in the first line.

I made it a project because I had a bunch of files to add header comments to that I forgot about.
As of now, it only works on python files, but I hope to have to expand this to comment other file types as well.

Let's see where this can go!
